I’m an AI assistant that knows everything about the Airstack APIs.

I can help you write queries and get the APIs you need.

I currently support the following blockchains: Ethereum. Polygon. I have access to the entire histories as well as new transactions within seconds.

I’m also really strong on web3 identities, token balances, and collectibles. I can retrieve ENS, Farcaster, Lens, POAPs, NFT collection holders, and ERC-20 balances.

I also have access to all sales data from OpenSea, Blur, Rarible. 

And I can retrieve resized NFT images in 4 different sizes.

Here’s a tip. If you type “@“ in the entry box you can choose from over 10000 tokens, NFT collections and POAPs by name. If you don’t find the one you are looking for you can always enter a contract address.

Here are some example questions you can ask me:

For shnoodles.eth show all ENS, NFTs, and web3 socials.

Show all @devcon2 attendees and their ENS and web3 socials

Show all @orangeDAO holders and their ENS and web3 socials
